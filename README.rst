HyperSpyUI tries to bring a streamlined user interface to the powerful
multi-dimensional analysis capabilities of HyperSpy_. HyperSpy is an open
source Python library which provides tools to facilitate data analysis of
multidimensional datasets.

HyperSpy aims at making it easy and natural to apply analytical procedures
that operate on an individual signal to multidimensional arrays, as well as
providing easy access to analytical tools that exploit the multidimensionality
of the dataset.

While the UI tries to create a simple and intuitive interface to HyperSpy, it
still retains the raw power of HyperSpy via the UIâ€™s built in IPython console,
which runs on the same Python kernel as the UI.


Installation
=============
There are several ways to install HyperSpyUI. The application itself is rather
simple to install, but its dependencies can be a bit more tricky.

Bundle Installer
----------------
If you're on Windows, the quickest way to get set up is to download and install
the HyperSpyUI bundle installer. The bundled WinPython_ distribution includes
all the dependencies of the program, and the installer also helps create
program shortucts and register common microscopy file formats with the
application.

The bundle installer can also be used if you already have installed a WinPython
distribution (e.g. via the `HyperSpy bundle`_), and just want to add HyperSpyUI
and its dependencies, although it might not support older versions.

Installation via pip and conda
------------------------------
If you want to install HyperSpyUI with pyqt5, you will need to install the 
lastest version or pyface (>= 6.0.0) and traitsui (>= 5.2.0).

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install hyperspy
    pip install hyperspyui

.. note:: (as of August 2018) Due to a lingering known issue_, the latest
   version of HyperSpyUI available through `pip` is not compatible with the
   updated pyface and traisui components. In order to get a working installation
   (which might have other bugs present), you will need to install the development
   version until this message is removed. You can do this via:
   
.. code-block:: bash

    pip uninstall hyperspyui # only if you have an existing hyperspyui version installed
    pip install git+git://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspyUI.git  
   

After installation, you can run HyperSpyUI from the command prompt with:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m hyperspyui
